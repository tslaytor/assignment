Task to build an crud application using oop

I have so far written the project without using git... and I felt a few times that this was a mistake.

I'm now trying to hose the application i created, but I'm getting errors now suggesting that the hosting service is using an older version of PHP, so some of my syntax isn't valid. Now seemed like a very good time to use git version control as I try to fix the issue.
